You can use Amazon Route 53 to configure DNS health checks to route traffic to healthy endpoints or to independently monitor the health of your application and its endpoints. Amazon Route 53 Traffic Flow makes it easy for you to manage traffic globally through a variety of routing types, including Latency Based Routing, Geo DNS, and Weighted Round Robin&mdash;all of which can be combined with DNS Failover in order to enable a variety of low-latency, fault-tolerant architectures. Using Amazon Route 53 Traffic Flow&rsquo;s simple visual editor, you can easily manage how your end-users are routed to your application&rsquo;s endpoints&mdash;whether in a single AWS region or distributed around the globe. Amazon Route 53 also offers Domain Name Registration &ndash; you can purchase and manage domain names such as example.com and Amazon Route 53 will automatically configure DNS settings for your domains.",

Simulate stateful behaviour in your mocked API using a simple finite state machine model. Dynamically render responses using the Handlebars templating language. Craft your simulation using the friendly, no-code UI or go fully automated with the 100% WireMock-compatible API. Capture traffic to another API, then play it back from MockLab. Mock the unfinished parts of the API and proxy the rest straight through to the real thing. Test your app to destruction by injecting delays, dropped connections, drip-drip responses and corrupt HTTP payloads. All the power and flexibility you need for pain-free testing.",
